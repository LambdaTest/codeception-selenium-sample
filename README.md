*Learn how to use Codeception framework to configure and run your PHP automation testing scripts on the LambdaTest platform*

* [Local Testing With Codeception](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin automation testing with Selenium and Codeception, you would need to:

* Make sure that you have the latest **PHP** installed on your system. You can download and install **PHP** using following commands in the terminal:

* **MacOS:** Previous versions of **MacOS** have **PHP** installed by default. But for the latest **MacOS** versions starting with **Monterey**, **PHP** has to be downloaded and installed manually by using below commands: 

  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  brew install php
  ```
* **Windows:** 

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php
  ```

**Note:** For **Windows**, you can download **PHP** from [here](http://windows.php.net/download/). Also, refer to this [documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php) for ensuring the accessibility of PHP through Command Prompt(cmd).

## Download composer in the project directory (use below links)
* [Linux/MacOS](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [Windows](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows)

**Note:** To use the **composer** command directly, it either should have been downloaded in the project directory or should be accessible globally which can be done by the command below(if not executed already as per composed download page steps):

  ```bash
  mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
  ```

### Installing Selenium Dependencies And Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTest Codeception-selenium-sample repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/codeception-selenium-sample
cd codeception-selenium-sample
```

**Step 2:** Install the composer dependencies in the current project directory using the command below:
```bash
composer install
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts. You can get these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=codeception-selenium-sample) or by your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=codeception-selenium-sample).

**Step 3:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.
  
  * For **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

## Run Your First Test


>**Test Scenario**: Check out the sample acceptance [FirstCest.php](https://github.com/LambdaTest/codeception-selenium-sample/blob/master/tests/acceptance/FirstCest.php) file. This Codeception Selenium script tests a sample to-do list app by marking couple items as done, adding a new item to the list and finally displaying the count of pending items as output.

### Configuration Of Your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** Refer to the [acceptance.yml](https://github.com/LambdaTest/codeception-selenium-sample/blob/master/tests/acceptance.suite.yml) file to update your test capabilities. 

Notice the declaration of class name **‚ÄúAcceptanceTester‚Äù**. We used this class to specify test configuration, port number, browser name, browser version and other desired capabilities.

> **Note:** You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of **[Desired Capability Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=codeception-selenium-sample)**.

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/codecept run --steps
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on LambdaTest Automation Dashboard. 

## Testing Locally Hosted Or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with LambdaTest Selenium grid using LambdaTest Tunnel. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using tunnel and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are live.

Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=codeception-selenium-sample) for more information.

Here‚Äôs how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for macOS](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
LT --user {user‚Äôs login email} --key {user‚Äôs access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:

```bash
LT --user lambdatest@example.com --key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**

```
$capability = array(
	"LT:Options" => array(
		"username" => "LT_USERNAME",
		"accessKey" => "LT_ACCESS_KEY",
		"tunnel" => true,
	)
);
```
